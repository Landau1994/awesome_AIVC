# Drug Discovery Applications

## Definition
> Drug discovery applications of AIVC involve using virtual cell models to predict drug responses, identify therapeutic targets, optimize compounds, and accelerate the drug development pipeline through in-silico experimentation.

## Key Ideas
- **Target identification**: Find genes/proteins to modulate
- **Response prediction**: Forecast cellular response to drugs
- **Combination therapy**: Predict drug combinations
- **Personalized medicine**: Patient-specific predictions

## AIVC Applications in Drug Discovery

### 1. Drug Response Prediction
```
Cell state + Drug structure → Predicted expression change
```
- [[01_Papers/CPA|CPA]]: Drug combinations
- [[01_Papers/chemCPA|chemCPA]]: Novel drugs

### 2. Target Identification
- Perturbation prediction to find key genes
- GRN analysis for master regulators
- [[01_Papers/GEARS|GEARS]]: Multi-gene effects

### 3. Virtual Screening
- Screen compound libraries in-silico
- Prioritize candidates for validation
- Reduce experimental costs

### 4. Mechanism of Action
- Understand drug effects at cellular level
- Identify off-target effects
- Cell type-specific responses
